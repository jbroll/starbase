<h2>Introducing Starbase</h2></a>

<a name="Q.1">
<h3> Q.1. What is Starbase? </h3></a>

Starbase is a simple relational database system developed by John Roll
that is specially suited for managing tables of astronomical data.  It
is made up of collection of UNIX programs that make use of standard
UNIX features and tools.  The basic table manipulating features are
similar to the /rdb system (but does not require it).  Extra support
for astronomical applications were implemented at the <B> Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory</B>.  The package also contains tools from
the <B> Star Link Project</B>.

<a name="Q.2">
<h3> Q.2. Why might I be interested in it? </h3></a>

Starbase's simple design makes it particularly well-suited for
manipulating "small" tables (&lt 100,000 rows?) containing astronomical
data.  With a little preparation in advance Starbase can handle very 
large tables  (hundreds of millions of rows). Here are some reasons why:

<ul>
  <li> The tables are plain ASCII with TABS delimiting the columns.
       This means you can:
       <ul>
	 <li> view them with cat, more, less, etc.
	 <li> edit them using your favorite editor
	 <li> integrate them easily into your own programs and
	      scripts. 
       </ul>
  <li> Starbase understands sexadecimal format used for things like
       right ascension and declination. 
  <li> Starbase provides funtions useful to astronomers
       such as coordinate precession, FK4-FK5 conversions, and
       searches by distance from a sky position.
  <li> Starbase requires no special shell so it can interact with
       standard UNIX tools, such as grep, awk, and sed.  
</ul>

<a name="Q.3">
<h3> Q.3. Where can Starbase be obtained? </h3></a>

Starbase can be downloaded from the starbase home page
<a href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~john/starbase/starbase.html">home page</a>


<a name="Q.4">
<h3> Q.4. How much does it cost? </h3></a>

Nothing--it's free.

<h2>Getting Started With Starbase</h2></a>

<a name="Q.5">
<h3> Q.5. What do I need to know to get started? </h3></a>

Check <a href="#Q.6">Q.6</a> for a quick overview of table format and
then <a href="#Q.7">Q.7</a> for an introduction to the most basic
commands.  <p> 

Starbase comes with HTML documentation.  A good place to start is the main
Starbase page (the starbase man page or <a
href="starbase.html">starbase</a>).  This lists and briefly describes the
programs that make up Starbase.  The extensions that have been added
at SAO are covered in the <a href="tawk.html"> tawk extensions </a> page.

<a name="Q.6">
<h3> Q.6. What is the format of a table file? </h3></a>

A Starbase table is a plain ASCII file with the following components:
<ul>
  <li> the first line is taken as the title of the table.
  <li> a section of comments made up of free-format text.  (Note that no
       comment character is needed.)
  <li> a two-line table header.  The first line gives the names of the
       columns, seperated by single TAB characters.  The second line
       is a set of dashed lines, one set for each column, seperated by
       TAB characters.  The dashed line signals the start of the table
       data.
  <li> rows of table data.  Each line is a table record where the
       values for each column are seperated by single TAB characters.
</ul>

Here's an example:
<pre>
Table1

This table is named Table1

This is a text comment in the header of a table.  This portion may 
ramble on and on but should not contain any line with ONLY dash (-)
and tab characters.  The dash line is the indication that the data
table is about to begin.

RA	Dec
--	---
0:0:0	0:0:0
12:00	-30.0
15	60:00:30.4
</pre>

If you use an editor to create a table, it's a good idea to look it
over to make sure that there is only one TAB character between each
column in a row.  To see where the TABS are, run <code>cat -tv table |
more</code>, where table is the name of the file containing the
table (see also <a href="#Q.12">Q.12</a>).  <p>

See the <a href="starbase.5.html">format man page</a> for more
examples of tables.

<a name="Q.7">
<h3> Q.7. What are the minimum commands I need to know to get started? </h3></a>

Refer to the <a href="starbase.html">starbase man page</a> for a
short summary of all the starbase commands.  For starters, though,
here's a quick explanation of the three commands you might use the
most.  

<h4><a href="justify.html">justify</a></h4>

Before you do anything interesting with a table, you often want to
just look at it.  A good way to do this is with the <a href="justify.html">
jusitfy</a> command, which will neaten up a table so that all the
columns are aligned.  Try,
<pre>
       justify &lt in.tbl | more
</pre>
where <code>in.tbl</code> is the input table.  Or,
<pre>
       justify -i in.tbl | more
</pre>
Tables are usually read into a starbase command either with the -i
option or with the UNIX input redirection operator, &lt.  The output
is usually either redirected to a file (using &gt) or piped into
another command like <code>more</code> or another starbase command.

<h4><a href="row.html">row</a></h4>

The most common fuction of a database is to allow one to extract
records that match certain conditions.  With Starbase, this is
accomplished with the <a href="row.html">row</a> command.  If the
table looks like the one given in <a href="#Q.6">Q.6</a> and is called
<code>in.tbl</code>, one can extract all rows where the RA is greater
or equal to 12 hours with: 
<pre>
    row 'RA>=12' < in.tbl > out.tbl
</pre>
Or,
<pre>
    row 'RA>11:59' < in.tbl | justify | more
</pre>
See <a href="#Q.8">Q.8</a> for a summary of all the operators one can
use to select rows of data.  Check also the <a href="starbase.5.html">
file format man page</a> to see how one can define special table
variables that can be used by the row command.

<h4><a href="column.html">column</a></h4>

Often one is only interested in seeing certain columns from a table
(especially if the rows are very long).  Using the example table from
<a href="#Q.6">Q.6</a>, <code>in.tbl</code>, one can extract just the
RA and Dec columns with:
<pre>
    row 'RA>11:59' < in.tbl | column RA Dec > out.tbl
</pre>
Or,
<pre>
    column RA Dec < in.tbl | row 'RA>11:59' > out.tbl
</pre>
Refer to question <a href="#Q.14">Q.14</a> if you get an error like
<em>column: RA: No such file or directory</em>.

<h4>Other useful commands</h4>

The <a href="header.html">header</a> and <a href="headoff.html">
headeroff</a> commands allow you to extract or remove the header
portion from a table.  <a href="compute.html">compute</a> allows you
to calculate new values for a column from other values in the row.
<a href="jointable.html">jointable</a> is used to combine rows
from two tables that have matching values in a column.  <p>

For a complete list, see the <a href="starbase.html">starbase man
page</a>.

<a name="Q.8">
<h3>Q.8. What are operators that can be used with the
<a href="row.html">row</a> command?</h3></a>

The <a href="row.html">row</a> and <a
href="compute.html">compute</a> commands makes use of the operators
supported by the UNIX awk command.  Here's a list of those used for
comparing two values:<p>

<table>
<tr><td>Operation</td> <td>operator</td> <td>example</td> </tr>
<tr><td>Equal</td> <td><code>==</code> <td>x == 40, s == "string"</td><tr>
<tr><td>Greater than</td> <td><code>&gt</code></td>
<td><code>x &gt 40, s &gt "string"</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>Greater than or equal</td> <td><code>&gt=</code></td>
    <td><code>x &gt= 40</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>Less than</td> <td><code>&lt</code></td> <td><code>x &lt 40</code>
<tr><td>Less than or equal</td> <td><code>&lt=</code></td>
    <td><code>x &lt= 40, s &lt= "string"</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>string contains</td> <td><code>~</code></td>
    <td><code>s ~ /string/</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>string does not contain</td> <td><code>!~</code></td>
    <td><code>s !~ /string/</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>Logical AND</td> <td><code>&&</code></td>
    <td><code>x &gt 5 && y &lt 40</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>Logical OR</td> <td><code>&&</code></td>
    <td><code>s ~ /big/ || s ~ /large/</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>Logical NOT</td> <td><code>!</code></td> <td><code>! x</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>Logical grouping</td> <td><code>( )</code></td>
    <td> (x &gt 5 && x &lt 11) || (x == 0 && y == 1) </td></tr>
</table><p>

<a name="Q.9">
<h3>Q.9. What is a regular expression?  How do I use it?</h3></a>

A regular expression is a way of representing a pattern of characters.
Such patterns are used to search for substrings in a string of
characters or to see if a string matches a particular pattern.  In
Starbase, one would use a regular expression with the row command to
search for records in which the text in a column matches a certain
pattern.  For example, in
<pre>
    row 'type ~ /gala/' &lt in.tbl &gt out.tbl
</pre>
"gala" is the regular expression.  This command returns all records in
which the string in the "type" column contains the substring "gala".
This includes galaxy, galaxies, and extragalactic.  <p>

The advantage of regular expressions is their ability to describe
patterns symbolically via <em>metacharacters</em>.  Here's some of the 
of the metacharacters you might use:

<table>
<tr><td>.</td>     <td> </td><td>matches any single character</td></tr>
<tr><td>*</td>     <td> </td><td>matches zero or more of the previous character
<tr><td>+</td>     <td> </td><td>matches one or more of the previous character
<tr><td>?</td>     <td> </td><td>matches zero or one of the previous character
<tr><td>^</td>     <td> </td><td>when at the beginning of a regular expression,
                                 matches the beginning of a value
<tr><td>$</td>     <td> </td><td>when at the end of a regular expression,
                                 matches the end of a value
<tr><td>[...]</td> <td> </td><td>matches any one of the characters between the
                                 brackets </td></tr>
<tr><td>[^...]</td><td> </td><td>matches any one character not among those
                                 between the brackets </td></tr>
<tr><td>\</td>     <td> </td><td>escapes the special meaning of the next
                                 character, e.g. \. means a real period.
</table>

Here are some sample uses:

<table>
<tr valign=top><td><code>type ~ /proto.*env/</code></td> <td> </td>
    <td>matches when type contains a substring beginning with "proto" and
        ending with "env", including "protostellar environment" and
        "protogalactic environment". </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><code>type ~ /[gG]ala/</code></td> <td> </td>
    <td>matches "gala" or "Gala" appearing anywhere in type</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><code>title ~ /^Study/</code></td> <td> </td>
    <td>matches when title begins with the "Study"</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><code>type ~ /^[gG]alaxy$/</code></td> <td> </td>
    <td>type is restricted to being equal to either "galaxy" or
        "Galaxy"</td></tr>
</table>

Note that some metacharacters are also interpreted by the UNIX shell.
That's why it is a good idea to enclose search clauses in single
quotes when using the <code>row</code> command.  <p>

<a name="Q.10">
<h3>Q.10. Are there any tutorials on Starbase and databases available? </h3></a>

Because of Starbase's similarity to the commercial /rdb package, the
book <em>UNIX Relational Database Management</em> by Manis, Schaffer, and
Jorgensen (Prentice Hall, ~$70) is often recommended.  Chapters 1, 2,
3, 4, and 6 will bring an astronomer new to relational databases up to
speed.

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<a name="Q.11">
<h3>Q.11. How do I find out about reported bugs in starbase programs?
    </h3></a> 

The most up-to-date list of bugs can be accessed from 
<a href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~john/starbase/BUGS">
http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~john/starbase/BUGS</a>.  The Starbase
distribution also comes with a list of bugs in a file called <kbd>
BUGS</kbd>.  <p>

<a name="Q.12">
<h3>Q.12. How can I tell the difference between spaces and TAB
    characters in my tables? </h3></a>

The most important thing to keep in mind when manipulating Starbase
tables is to make sure that one and only one TAB character appears
between each column.  Normally, one only needs to worry about this
when editing tables by hand.  It's often easy to accidently insert
spaces where a TAB should, or to insert multiple TABs where only one
should go.  (The Emacs editor by default will often replace spaces
with TABs without your knowing it--see <a href="#Q.13">Q.13</a> for
more details.)  <p>

Thus, if you've been editing a Starbase table by hand, you may wish to
check it over to ensure that the TABs are where they belong.  To do
this you can use the UNIX <code>cat</code> command by specifying the
"-vt" options:
<pre>
    cat -vt in.tbl | more
</pre>
TAB characters in the table will appear as "^I".  You might find the
output a bit of a jumble.  If so, you might try sending the table
through the justify command first:
<pre>
    justify -i in.tbl | cat -vt | more
</pre>

<a name="Q.13">
<h3>Q.13. Emacs keeps screwing up the TABs in my table!  How can I
    make it behave?</h3></a>

If you use a recent version of the Emacs editor to edit a Starbase
table, you may find that it sometimes corrupts the TAB structure of
the table.  This is usually due to a default feature of the Emacs Text
Mode: when you hit the TAB key, not only will Emacs insert a TAB
character, it will also replace as many of the preceding spaces with
TAB characters as possible while still keeping the same alignment.
<p>

To make your Emacs compatible with Starbase, you need tell Emacs to
only insert a single TAB when you hit the TAB key.  This can be
accomplished by placing the following into your .emacs file (normally
in your home directory):
<pre>
(defun my-text-mode-hook ()
  (define-key text-mode-map "\t" 'self-insert-command))
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'my-text-mode-hook)
</pre>

<a name="Q.14">
<h3>Q.14. Whenever I try to use the <code>column</code> command, I get a
    <em>"No such file or directory"</em> error.  </h3></a>

If when you issue the command:
<pre>
    column RA &lt in.tbl &gt out.tbl
</pre>
you get the error message <em>column: RA: No such file or
directory</em>, you may need to adjust your command search path.  Some
UNIX systems come with a another command called "column" (e.g. Linux
has /usr/bin/column) not related to Starbase.  To make sure the
Starbase version gets called, place the directory containing the
Starbase commands closer to the beginning of your search path.  For
example, if the starbase commands are located in
/usr/local/starbase/bin, you can (if you are using the C-shell) type:
<pre>
    set path = (/usr/local/starbase/bin $path)
</pre>
