<H1>Local getdate modifications for Starbase</H1>

The version of getdate for starbase has been modified to conform to the FITS
standard.  FITS header DATEOBJ keywords specify the date in dd/mm/yy format
and getdate has been modified to accept this instead of the US convention of
mm/dd/yy.

Our units of temporal measurement, from seconds on up to months, are so
complicated, asymmetrical and disjunctive so as to make coherent mental
reckoning in time all but impossible.  Indeed, had some tyrannical god
contrived to enslave our minds to time, to make it all but impossible
for us to escape subjection to sodden routines and unpleasant surprises,
he could hardly have done better than handing down our present system.
It is like a set of trapezoidal building blocks, with no vertical or
horizontal surfaces, like a language in which the simplest thought
demands ornate constructions, useless particles and lengthy
circumlocutions.  Unlike the more successful patterns of language and
science, which enable us to face experience boldly or at least
level-headedly, our system of temporal calculation silently and
persistently encourages our terror of time.

<P>
...  It is as though architects had to measure length in feet, width
in meters and height in ells; as though basic instruction manuals
demanded a knowledge of five different languages.  It is no wonder then
that we often look into our own immediate past or future, last Tuesday
or a week from Sunday, with feelings of helpless confusion.  ...

This section describes the textual date representations that GNU
programs accept.  These are the strings you, as a user, can supply as
arguments to the various programs.  The C interface (via the
<CODE>getdate</CODE> function) is not described here.

Although the date syntax here can represent any possible time since zero
A.D., computer integers are not big enough for such a (comparatively)
long time.  The earliest date semantically allowed on Unix systems is
midnight, 1 January 1970 UCT.

A <EM>date</EM> is a string, possibly empty, containing many items
separated by whitespace.  The whitespace may be omitted when no
ambiguity arises.  The empty string means the beginning of today (i.e.,
midnight).  Order of the items is immaterial.  A date string may contain
many flavors of items:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>calendar date items

<LI>time of the day items

<LI>time zone items

<LI>day of the week items

<LI>relative items

<LI>pure numbers.

</UL>

<P>
We describe each of these item types in turn, below.

<A NAME="IDX131"></A>
<A NAME="IDX132"></A>
<A NAME="IDX133"></A>
A few numbers may be written out in words in most contexts.  This is
most useful for specifying day of the week items or relative items (see
below).  Here is the list: <SAMP>`first'</SAMP> for 1, <SAMP>`next'</SAMP> for 2,
<SAMP>`third'</SAMP> for 3, <SAMP>`fourth'</SAMP> for 4, <SAMP>`fifth'</SAMP> for 5,
<SAMP>`sixth'</SAMP> for 6, <SAMP>`seventh'</SAMP> for 7, <SAMP>`eighth'</SAMP> for 8,
<SAMP>`ninth'</SAMP> for 9, <SAMP>`tenth'</SAMP> for 10, <SAMP>`eleventh'</SAMP> for 11 and
<SAMP>`twelfth'</SAMP> for 12.  Also, <SAMP>`last'</SAMP> means exactly <EM>-1</EM>.

When a month is written this way, it is still considered to be written
numerically, instead of being "spelled in full"; this changes the
allowed strings.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX135"></A>
<A NAME="IDX136"></A>
Alphabetic case is completely ignored in dates.  Comments may be introduced
between round parentheses, as long as included parentheses are properly
nested.  Hyphens not followed by a digit are currently ignored.  Leading
zeros on numbers are ignored.

A <EM>calendar date item</EM> specifies a day of the year.  It is
specified differently, depending on whether the month is specified
numerically or literally.  All these strings specify the same calendar date:

</P>

<PRE>
1970-09-17           # ISO 8601.
70-9-17              # This century assumed by default.
70-09-17             # Leading zeros are ignored.
9/17/72              # Common U.S. writing.
24 September 1972
24 Sept 72           # September has a special abbreviation.
24 Sep 72            # Three-letter abbreviations always allowed.
Sep 24, 1972
24-sep-72
24sep72
</PRE>

<P>
The year can also be omitted.  In this case, the last specified year is
used, or the current year if none.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
9/17
sep 17
</PRE>

<P>
Here are the rules.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX138"></A>
<A NAME="IDX139"></A>
For numeric months, the ISO 8601 format
<SAMP>`<VAR>year</VAR>-<VAR>month</VAR>-<VAR>day</VAR>'</SAMP> is allowed, where <VAR>year</VAR> is
any positive number, <VAR>month</VAR> is a number between 01 and 12, and
<VAR>day</VAR> is a number between 01 and 31.  A leading zero must be present
if a number is less than ten.  If <VAR>year</VAR> is less than 100, then 1900
is added to it to force a date in this century.  The construct
<SAMP>`<VAR>month</VAR>/<VAR>day</VAR>/<VAR>year</VAR>'</SAMP>, popular in the United States,
is accepted.  Also <SAMP>`<VAR>month</VAR>/<VAR>day</VAR>'</SAMP>, omitting the year.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX140"></A>
<A NAME="IDX141"></A>
Literal months may be spelled out in full: <SAMP>`January'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`February'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`March'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`April'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`May'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`June'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`July'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`August'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`September'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`October'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`November'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`December'</SAMP>.  Literal months may be abbreviated
to their first three letters, possibly followed by an abbreviating dot.
It is also permitted to write <SAMP>`Sept'</SAMP> instead of <SAMP>`September'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
When months are written literally, the calendar date may be given as any
of the following:

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>day</VAR> <VAR>month</VAR> <VAR>year</VAR>
<VAR>day</VAR> <VAR>month</VAR>
<VAR>month</VAR> <VAR>day</VAR> <VAR>year</VAR>
<VAR>day</VAR>-<VAR>month</VAR>-<VAR>year</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
Or, omitting the year:

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>month</VAR> <VAR>day</VAR>
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC101" HREF="tar_toc.html#TOC101">Time of day item</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX142"></A>

</P>
<P>
A <EM>time of day item</EM> in date strings specifies the time on a given
day.  Here are some examples, all of which represent the same time:

</P>

<PRE>
20:02:0
20:02
8:02pm
20:02-0500      # In EST (Eastern U.S. Standard Time).
</PRE>

<P>
More generally, the time of the day may be given as
<SAMP>`<VAR>hour</VAR>:<VAR>minute</VAR>:<VAR>second</VAR>'</SAMP>, where <VAR>hour</VAR> is
a number between 0 and 23, <VAR>minute</VAR> is a number between 0 and
59, and <VAR>second</VAR> is a number between 0 and 59.  Alternatively,
<SAMP>`:<VAR>second</VAR>'</SAMP> can be omitted, in which case it is taken to
be zero.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX143"></A>
<A NAME="IDX144"></A>
<A NAME="IDX145"></A>
<A NAME="IDX146"></A>
If the time is followed by <SAMP>`am'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`pm'</SAMP> (or <SAMP>`a.m.'</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`p.m.'</SAMP>), <VAR>hour</VAR> is restricted to run from 1 to 12, and
<SAMP>`:<VAR>minute</VAR>'</SAMP> may be omitted (taken to be zero).  <SAMP>`am'</SAMP>
indicates the first half of the day, <SAMP>`pm'</SAMP> indicates the second
half of the day.  In this notation, 12 is the predecessor of 1:
midnight is <SAMP>`12am'</SAMP> while noon is <SAMP>`12pm'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX147"></A>
<A NAME="IDX148"></A>
The time may alternatively be followed by a timezone correction,
expressed as <SAMP>`<VAR>s</VAR><VAR>hh</VAR><VAR>mm</VAR>'</SAMP>, where <VAR>s</VAR> is <SAMP>`+'</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>, <VAR>hh</VAR> is a number of zone hours and <VAR>mm</VAR> is a number
of zone minutes.  When a timezone correction is given this way, it
forces interpretation of the time in UTC, overriding any previous
specification for the timezone or the local timezone.  The <VAR>minute</VAR>
part of the time of the day may not be elided when a timezone correction
is used.  This is the only way to specify a timezone correction by
fractional parts of an hour.

</P>
<P>
Either <SAMP>`am'</SAMP>/<SAMP>`pm'</SAMP> or a timezone correction may be specified,
but not both.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC102" HREF="tar_toc.html#TOC102">Timezone item</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX149"></A>

</P>
<P>
A <EM>timezone item</EM> specifies an international timezone, indicated by
a small set of letters.  Any included period is ignored.  Military
timezone designations use a single letter.  Currently, only integral
zone hours may be represented in a timezone item.  See the previous
section for a finer control over the timezone correction.

</P>

Here are many non-daylight-savings-time timezones, indexed by the zone
hour value.

The explicit mention of a day of the week will forward the date
(only if necessary) to reach that day of the week in the future.

Days of the week may be spelled out in full: <SAMP>`Sunday'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`Monday'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`Tuesday'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`Wednesday'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`Thursday'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`Friday'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`Saturday'</SAMP>.  Days may be abbreviated to their

<SAMP>`Wednesday'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`Thur'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`Thurs'</SAMP> for <SAMP>`Thursday'</SAMP> are
also allowed.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX183"></A>
<A NAME="IDX184"></A>
A number may precede a day of the week item to move forward
supplementary weeks.  It is best used in expression like <SAMP>`third
monday'</SAMP>.  In this context, <SAMP>`last <VAR>day</VAR>'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`next
<VAR>day</VAR>'</SAMP> is also acceptable; they move one week before or after
the day that <VAR>day</VAR> by itself would represent.

A comma following a day of the week item is ignored.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX185"></A>
<A NAME="IDX186"></A>

</P>
<P>
<EM>Relative items</EM> adjust a date (or the current date if none) forward
or backward.  The effects of relative items accumulate.  Here are some
examples:

</P>

<A NAME="IDX190"></A>
<A NAME="IDX191"></A>
<A NAME="IDX192"></A>
<A NAME="IDX193"></A>
The unit of time displacement may be selected by the string <SAMP>`year'</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`month'</SAMP> for moving by whole years or months.  These are fuzzy
units, as years and months are not all of equal duration.  More precise
units are <SAMP>`fortnight'</SAMP> which is worth 14 days, <SAMP>`week'</SAMP> worth 7
days, <SAMP>`day'</SAMP> worth 24 hours, <SAMP>`hour'</SAMP> worth 60 minutes,
<SAMP>`minute'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`min'</SAMP> worth 60 seconds, and <SAMP>`second'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`sec'</SAMP> worth one second.  An <SAMP>`s'</SAMP> suffix on these units is
accepted and ignored.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX194"></A>
The unit of time may be preceded by a multiplier, given as an optionally
signed number.  Unsigned numbers are taken as positively signed.  No
number at all implies 1 for a multiplier.  Following a relative item by
the string <SAMP>`ago'</SAMP> is equivalent to preceding the unit by a
multiplicator with value <EM>-1</EM>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX195"></A>
<A NAME="IDX196"></A>
<A NAME="IDX197"></A>
The string <SAMP>`tomorrow'</SAMP> is worth one day in the future (equivalent
to <SAMP>`day'</SAMP>), the string <SAMP>`yesterday'</SAMP> is worth
one day in the past (equivalent to <SAMP>`day ago'</SAMP>).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX198"></A>
<A NAME="IDX199"></A>
<A NAME="IDX200"></A>
The strings <SAMP>`now'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`today'</SAMP> are relative items corresponding
to zero-valued time displacement, these strings come from the fact
a zero-valued time displacement represents the current time when not
otherwise change by previous items.  They may be used to stress other
items, like in <SAMP>`12:00 today'</SAMP>.  The string <SAMP>`this'</SAMP> also has
the meaning of a zero-valued time displacement, but is preferred in
date strings like <SAMP>`this thursday'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
When a relative item makes the resulting date to cross the boundary
between DST and non-DST (or vice-versa), the hour is adjusted according
to the local time.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC105" HREF="tar_toc.html#TOC105">Pure numbers in date strings</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX201"></A>

</P>
<P>
The precise intepretation of a pure decimal number is dependent of
the context in the date string.

</P>
<P>
If the decimal number is of the form <VAR>yyyy</VAR><VAR>mm</VAR><VAR>dd</VAR> and no
other calendar date item (see section <A HREF="tar_7.html#SEC100">Calendar date item</A>) appears before it
in the date string, then <VAR>yyyy</VAR> is read as the year, <VAR>mm</VAR> as the
month number and <VAR>dd</VAR> as the day of the month, for the specified
calendar date.

</P>
<P>
If the decimal number is of the form <VAR>hh</VAR><VAR>mm</VAR> and no other time
of day item appears before it in the date string, then <VAR>hh</VAR> is read
as the hour of the day and <VAR>mm</VAR> as the minute of the hour, for the
specified time of the day.  <VAR>mm</VAR> can also be omitted.

</P>
<P>
If both a calendar date and a time of day appear to the left of a number
in the date string, but no relative item, then the number overrides the
year.
