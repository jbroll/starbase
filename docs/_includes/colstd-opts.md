- -i *file* Read input from *file* instead of the standard input.
- -o *file* Write output to *file* instead of the standard output.
- -t *template* Only the tables whose table names (first line in the table
   header) match *template* are output.  Care should be taken with this
   option, unnamed tables are skipped if it is specified.  This is the primary
   mechanism for selecting a table from a multi-table file.
